# Openstack Control
This script let's you easily interact with openstack. You can:
- Upload or remove images
- Create or delete virtual machines running on openstack

## Set up environment variables
In order to authenticate the user with Openstack a number of environment variables are needed. These are normally contained in a script generated by Openstack. In order to add the variables in this script to your environment variables run:
```bash
source <name_of_script>
```
The values needed are:
```
OS_AUTH_URL
OS_USERNAME
OS_PASSWORD
OS_PROJECT_NAME
OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME
OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME
```

## Set up an alias for easier usage
```bash
alias ostack='~/includeos-tools/openstack_control/openstack_control.py'
```

## Quick reference guide
- To use the short form to upload and launch an image in your current directory
```bash
ostack --instant
```

- In order to upload an image named `example` located at `~/ex.img`
```bash
./openstack_control.py --upload_image example --image_path ~/ex.img
```

- To create an image based on this newly uploaded image running on an easily acessed IP 
```bash
./openstack_control.py --create new_vm --image example --flavor includeos.nano --network FloatingPool01 
```
